# 1. If type is not specified, it is assumed to be using the project type.
# 2. Public cells's lock script is `project-public-lock`, which would check the Type ID of the admin cell.
# 3. Intent Cells' and User Cells' lock script is `project-user-lock`, which would check the proxied authentication. If overridable is true, it is unlockable if the recipe can be properly verified.
# 4. By fungible, it means there might be multiple cells of the same type that can be merged together, and there could be change cells in the output.
